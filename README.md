(1) Please place all the following functions in 1 folder:
RunMe.m, anms.m, apply_homography.m, est_homography.m, feat_desc.m, feat_match.m, mymosaic.m, performmosaic.m and ransac_est_homography.m
(2) Run the "RunMe.m" for the Demo Script
(3) Feel free to change the image folder path and thresholds on RunMe.m
(4) Note that the code will take all the images for stitching in the image folder path, also the code assumes that the images are given in order. It is not advisable to feed in more than 4 images to the code. Also the images should have atleast 20% overlap between them.
